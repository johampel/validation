 * Binds a rule method parameter to the parent object being validated.
 * <p>
 * Annotations of this type are used for parameters of methods annotated with the {@link RuleDef} annotation and ensure that, when the
 * method is invoked as a validation rule, the parameter is filled with the parent object being validated (see also
 * {@link ValidationContext#getParentFacts() ValidationContext.getParentFacts()}).
 * <p>
 * The core library makes not implicit type conversion, so that the method parameter type must match the type of the object being validated.
 * The default spring implementation tries such a conversion
