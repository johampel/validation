/**
 * Simple {@link PathResolver} for any kind of beans.
 * <p>
 * This is based on a {@link CollectionPathResolver}. In addition to the capabilities inherited from there (allow adressing elements in
 * {@code Collections} and {@code Maps} with strings as keys) it allows to address properties of PoJos/Beans.
 * <p>
 * The syntax of the {@link ComponentPath ComponentPaths} is the same like for {@code CollectionPathResolver}, but in addition a single
 * component might be also interpreted as the name of a bean property. So having a Java record like
 * {@code record Person(String name, Collection<Person> friends)} allows path like "**&#47;friends/*&#47;name" to select the names of all
 * friends that appears somewhere in the object graph.
 * <p>
 * The strategy to find the properties is outsourced in the {@link BeanAccessor}, which is by default an implementation that finds all the
 * getters for normal Java Beans as well for Java records.
