/**
 * Path to a value or component of an object.
 * <p>
 * A {@code Path} can be seen as an address of a value. For example, having a file system, a full
 * qualified filename might be seen as a {@code Path}, since such a fully qualified filename allows
 * to address a file in the file system.
 * <p>
 * In terms of this interface, a {@code Path} is a quite abstract concept, since it does not make
 * any assumptions, how a {@code Path} must kook like. The basic idea is that a {@code Path} can be
 * used in conjunction with a {@link PathResolver} to construct and resolve it.
 * <p>
 * A {@code Path} might be a {@linkplain #isPattern() pattern} or a
 * {@linkplain #isConcrete() concrete}: A concrete {@code Path} is the address for exactly one value
 * (e.g. in case of a file system: the exact path to a single file system entry). A concrete
 * {@code Path} is either {@link PathResolver#resolve(Object, Path) resolvable} or not (so it exists
 * or not).
 * <p>
 * In contrast, a pattern {@code Path} represents not an exact value address, but a group of
 * concrete {@code Paths} that follow some common schema. For example, in a file system, an example
 * for a pattern might be the string {@code *.sh}, which selects a file entries having the suffix
 * {@code .sh}. This kind of {@code Path} cannot be resolved to a specific value directly, but it is
 * possible to {@linkplain PathResolver#resolvePattern(Object, Path) resolve the pattern}, so that
 * one get a stream of concrete {@code Paths} matching the pattern.
 *
