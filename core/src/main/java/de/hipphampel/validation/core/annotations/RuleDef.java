/**
 * Annotates a class member to define a new {@link Rule}.
 * <p>
 * Annotations of this type are evaluated by the {@link RuleDefHandler}.
 * <p>
 * The exact behaviour of this annotation depends on the member being annotated:
 * <p>
 * If the annotated object is a field, then the field must be final, not-null and have the type {@link Condition} or {@link Predicate}. The
 * {@code AnnotationRuleRepository} then creates a {@link ConditionRule} for it, whereas the missing information (like the id) is taken from
 * the annotation.
 * <p>
 * If the annotated object is a method, then the following restrictions apply:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>The return type of the method must be either a {@link Result} or a {@link Boolean} or a {@code boolean}. Booleans are automatically
 *   converted to {@code Results}. Any other return type will cause the {@code Rule} to return a failed result (at least by default)</li>
 *   <li>The method must have at least one parameter; all parameters must be bound via one of the bind annotations: {@link BindContext},
 *   {@link BindFacts}, {@link BindParentFacts}, {@link BindRootFacts}, {@link BindContextParameter}, {@link BindPath}, or
 *   {@link BindMetadata}.</li>
 *   <li>For simplicity the following shortcuts exists:
 *   <ul>
 *     <li>If the method has exactly one parameter having none of the binding annotations mentioned above, {@code BindFacts} is implicitly
 *      assumed</li>
 *     <li>If the method has exactly two parameter having name of the binding annotations mentioned above and the first parameter has the
 *      type {@link ValidationContext}, {@code BindFacts} is implicitly assumed for the second and {@code BindContext} for the first
 *      parameter</li>
 *   </ul>
 *   </li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Generally, the member might be static or not. If it is not static, the {@code Rule} implementation might refer to the state that is
 * provided be the enclosing class.
 * <p>
 * In opposite to {@link RuleRef}, this annotation defines a new {@code Rule}.
