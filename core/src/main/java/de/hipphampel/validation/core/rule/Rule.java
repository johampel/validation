/**
 * Represents a single validation rule.
 * <p>
 * A validation rule is checks, whether a certain statement is true for a given object. Such a
 * statement can be quite simple (e.g. in case of numbers: "the number is positive"), or more
 * complex (e.g. in case oft polygons: "the polygon build a rectangular triangle")
 * <p>
 * In terms of this library, a validation rule consists of:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>An unique {@link #getId() id} to identify the rule</li>
 *   <li>a method called {@link #validate(ValidationContext, Object) validate} that checks,
 *   whether the statement to check is true or false</li>
 *   <li>Also it might contain {@link #getPreconditions() preconditions} that need to be truw before
 *   the statement itself can be checked</li>
 *   <li>Finally, {@link #getMetadata() metadata} allows to attach further fixed data to the
 *   rule</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * A rule is exeucted by a {@link RuleExecutor}, which ensures that the preconditions and the
 * validate methods are called in the correct order and only, if allowed.
 * <p>
 * It is recommended, to use the {@link AbstractRule} as a base class for complex rule
 * implementations or use the {@link RuleBuilder} to construct more simple rules.
 *
 * @param <T> The type of the object to validate.
 * @see RuleExecutor
 * @see AbstractRule
