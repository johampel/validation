/**
 * {@link Rule} implementation that runs some validation for several {@link Path Paths}.
 * <p>
 * In opposite to the {@link DispatchingRule}, which delegates the validation for several {@code Paths} to different {@code Rules}, this is
 * a lightweight alternative when you want to execute the validation logic for several {@code Paths}. Instead of delegating the validation
 * of a specific {@code Path} to a further {@link Rule}, this implementation simply resolves all {@code Paths} and calls the method
 * {@link #validatePath(ValidationContext, Object, Object, Path) validatePath} method of this class instead, so there is no need to
 * implement some additional rule.
 * <p>
 * The {@code validate} method first calls {@link #getPaths(ValidationContext, Object) getPaths} and then directly calls for each
 * {@code Path} that exists the {@code validatePath} method. It finally calls {@link #aggregateResult(List) aggregateResult} to form the
 * final result of this validation rule.
 * <p>
 * There are some things to keep in mind when using the class, since it makes some shortcuts due to simplicity and performance
 * considerations:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>When one of the {@code Paths} returned by {@code getPaths} does not exist, the {@code validatePath} method is not called,
 *   so this type of rule is not intended to check for path existence, you simply get nothing if the path does not exist </li>
 *   <li>All {@code Paths} are validated one after another, there is no parallelism in place. In case that your rule logic contains
 *   blocking operations, such as service calls, it might be better to use the {@link DispatchingRule} approach instead with the
 *   option to parallelize the work</li>
 *   <li>The aggregation of the rule result filters out all sub results having no reason. The final result is has the highest
 *   severity of the resuls produces by {@code validatePath}. This behaviour can be modified by overriding {@code aggregateResult}.</li>
 *   <li>There is no further interaction with the {@link ValidationContext}, esp. the methods {@code enterPath} and {@code leavePath}
 *   are NOT called.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param <T> The type of the object being validated
 * @param <P> The type the of the object the paths resolve to.
