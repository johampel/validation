/**
 * Validation core library.
 * <p>
 * This package itself contains just the core classes like
 * {@link de.hipphampel.validation.core.Validator Validator} and
 * {@link de.hipphampel.validation.core.ValidatorBuilder ValidatorBuilder} that are intended for
 * clients to run validations.
 * <p>
 * A concrete {@code Validator} normally uses classes and concepts defined in the sub packages,
 * like:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@link de.hipphampel.validation.core.rule.Rule Rules} which contain the business logic of
 *   validation rules and {@link de.hipphampel.validation.core.provider.RuleRepository
 *   RuleRepositories} that make these rules available</li>
 *   <li>{@link de.hipphampel.validation.core.report.Reporter Reporters} that are intended to form
 *   the final validation result</li>
 *   <li>More technical driven classes, like
 *   {@link de.hipphampel.validation.core.execution.RuleExecutor RuleExecutors} to control the
 *   rule execution and {@link de.hipphampel.validation.core.path.PathResolver PathResolvers} that
 *   allow to access the different values of the objects being validated</li>
 * </ol>
