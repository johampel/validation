/**
 * {@link PathResolver} implementation for collection based objects.
 * <p>
 * This implementation can resolve paths on any kind of objects that implement the {@link Collection} interface and on {@link Map Maps} that
 * use a {@code String} as a key. This makes it suitable for all objects being JSON serializable, since in JSON any object can be seen as a
 * composition of atomic values, lists and maps. The only restriction regarding {@code Collections} is that when iterating through them, the
 * order is stable, if iterating it twice or more times.
 * <p>
 * This implementation uses the {@link ComponentPath} as representation for a  {@link Path}. The components represent either keys in a map
 * or the string representation of collection indices, so the path "2" being applied to a collection would resolve to the third element in
 * the collection. Note that the implementation makes no distinction between maps and collections: a component named "2" could be also seen
 * as key for a map.
 * <p>
 * Apart from that this implementation follows the same semantics as described for its base class, the
 * {@link AbstractComponentPathResolver}
 *
 * @see AbstractComponentPathResolver
 * @see ComponentPath
