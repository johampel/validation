 * of this interface, but typically implemented in the {@link #validate(ValidationContext, Object) validate} method.

 * {@link Result}, if no {@code Rule} or merge {@code Results} if more than one {@code Rule} is executed. For these purposes the interface
 * provides some helper methods with a default implementation.
