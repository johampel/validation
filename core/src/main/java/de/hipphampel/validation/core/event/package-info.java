/**
 * Event related components.
 * <p>
 * During validation, a {@link de.hipphampel.validation.core.event.EventPublisher} is used to publish events to the client. Such events are
 * sent, when the execution of a {@link de.hipphampel.validation.core.rule.Rule Rule} starts or ends, but an application/{@code Rule}
 * implementation is also allowed to send its own events.
 * <p>
 * While the {@code EventPublisher} is for sending, the {@link de.hipphampel.validation.core.event.EventSubscriber} is the part that is
 * intended to add {@link de.hipphampel.validation.core.event.EventListener} to be called when an event occurs. Conceptually,
 * {@code EventPublishers} and {@code EvenSubscriber} might be different objects, but with the
 * {@link de.hipphampel.validation.core.event.DefaultSubscribableEventPublisher} there is also one implementation that unifies both.
 * <p>
 * {@code EventPublisher} and {@code EventSubscriber} are more infrastructural objects that should be provided by the
 * {@link de.hipphampel.validation.core.Validator Validator}.
 *
 * @see de.hipphampel.validation.core.event.EventSubscriber
 * @see de.hipphampel.validation.core.event.EventPublisher
