/**
 * Used inside {@link RuleDef} annotations to define precondtions of a {@link Rule}.
 * <p>
 * This annotation allows to define the preconditions of the rule. A single precondition becomes {@code true}, if the {@code rules}
 * mentioned in the annotation evaluate to {@code OK} for all {@code paths}.
 * <p>
 * Usage example:
 * <pre>
 *     &#64;RuleDef(id = "parent",
 *       preconditions = {
 *           &#64;Precondition(rules = "child", paths="aPath")
 *       })
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * In the example above, the {@code Rule} with the id {@code parent} has a precondition that becomes {@code true}, if the {@code Rule} with
 * the id {@code child} evaluates to {@code OK} (for path {@code aPath}).
