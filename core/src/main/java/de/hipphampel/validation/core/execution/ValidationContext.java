/**
 * Contextual information passed to a {@link Rule} when executing it.
 * <p>
 * First of all, the {@code ValidationContext} provides information about the {@code Rule} and object currently being validated. For this
 * purpose, it provides several callback methods that are called by the {@link RuleExecutor}. For example
 * {@link #enterRule(Rule, Object) enterRule} and {@link #leaveRule() leaveRule} are called by the {@code RuleExecutor}, when a {@code Rule}
 * is entered or left, it influences then the {@link #getRuleStack() ruleStack} and the {@link #getCurrentRule() currentRule}.
 * <p>
 * Secondly, the {@code ValidationContext} provides access to infrastructural/shared objects, like the {@link PathResolver},
 * {@link RuleExecutor}, {@link EventPublisher}, {@link Reporter}, and {@link RuleRepository}, or more in general to so called <i>shared
 * objects</i>, which can be registered at any time you want in the {@code ValidationContext}, but stay always the same.
 * <p>
 * Thirdly, the {@code Validator} might pass validation parameters to the validation. These parameters might be used to influence the
 * validation behaviour.
 * <p>
 * It is guaranteed that an instance of the {@code ValidationContext} is only accessed by one single thread at any point of time. But since
 * {@code Rules} might be executed asynchronously, there is a need to create a {@link #copy() copy} of the {@code ValidationContext} from
 * time to time. The contract is that the copied instance must return exactly the same objects for the infrastructural or shared objects,
 * for all other objects a deep copy is sufficient.
 * <p>
 * Normally, an <b>initial</b> {@code ValidationContext} is created by the {@link Validator} when calling a {@code validate*} method, so in
 * general, the lifetime of the initial {@code ValidationContext} is limited to the execution of all rules for a single object. During rule
 * execution, especially when it is done in an asynchronous way - the validation might create deep copies of the the initial context.
